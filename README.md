# Lithium_Ion_Battery_Project
Goal: Scrape data table from a wikipedia, clean data, and plot cylindrical LIB cell energies

I took on this project as a test of my knowledge gained through my personal coding journey.  I was happy to have completed much of the code on my own, but of course search engines and all of the committed programming resources out there helped me along the way!
